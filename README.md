Rules engine for the tabletop card game **The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls**, based on the video game **The Binding of Issac**, made by series creator Edmund McMillen.

The goal of the project is to simulate game matches of the tabletop card game using a client-server infrastructure.
Players will be able to play matches with their friends over the Internet using a desktop/web client.
